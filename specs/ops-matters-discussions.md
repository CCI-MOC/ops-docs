# Use Github Issues on this repository (CCI-MOC/ops-docs) for ops discussions

We need a place to have discussion about our operational policy.
The idea is to create issues on github and discuss the policy there.

## Problem Description

It is not ideal to discuss operational matters in group chats because:

* it's not easier to add more people to the discussion
* messages get lost in long chat threads.
* chats are not async enough.

## Policy

Users will create issues on this repository to discuss operational matters.
People can then comment on the github issues, or respond via email to take
part in those discussions.

An issue can be assigned to someone or multiple people, it can also be linked
from a trello card.

Memebers of the #coredev channels should be encouraged to watch this repository
so they'll get email notifications when a new issue is opened or when there's
any discussion.

## Alternatives & History

An alternative would be to setup an `ops-chat` mailing list proposed here:

https://github.com/larsks/ops-policy/commit/486a30e9ca8f1e18e5c24f19e4342c89d656a501

We already have mailman, so it's pretty easy to create a mailing list.
I am not sure how we will archive the mailing lists though.
