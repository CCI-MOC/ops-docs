# The title of the policy

Introduction paragraph -- why are we doing anything?

## Problem Description

A detailed description of the problem.

## Policy

Here is where you cover the change you propose to make in detail. How do you
propose to solve this problem?

If the policy seeks to modify a process or workflow followed by the
team, explain how and why.

If this is one part of a larger effort make it clear where this piece ends. In
other words, what's the scope of this policy?

## Alternatives & History

What other ways could we do this thing? Why aren't we using those? This doesn't
have to be a full literature review, but it should demonstrate that thought has
been put into why the proposed solution is an appropriate one.

If the policy changes over time, summarize the changes here. The exact
details are always available by looking at the git history, but
summarizing them will make it easier for anyone to follow the desired
policy and understand when and why it might have changed.

## Implementation

### Author(s)

Who is leading the writing of the policy? If more than one person is
working on it, please designate the primary author and contact.

### Milestones

When will the policy go into effect?

If there is a built-in deprecation period for the policy, or criteria
that would trigger it no longer being in effect, describe them.

### Work Items

List any concrete steps we need to take to implement the policy.
