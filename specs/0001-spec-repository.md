# MOC Operational Policy Repository

This describes our approach to documenting MOC operational policy and
procedures.

## Problem Description

We want to establish various policies around the management of our
infrastructure, but we don't have an established place to put such
documentation.

## Policy

We will establish an operational documentation repository in the [CCI-MOC][]
organization on [GitHub][].

[cci-moc]: https://github.com/CCI-MOC
[github]: https://github.com/

## Alternatives & History

There is an existing [MOC documentation repository][docs], but this is an
amalgam of both end-user facing and internal operational documents. Much of the
content is of historical interest only. Because of the mixed content, it is
difficult to establish clear policies for approving pull requests, and due to
the volume of material it can be hard to discover relevant operational
documentation.

## Implementation

### Author(s)

Primary author: lars@redhat.com

### Milestones

We expect this policy to take effect as soon as it has been approved.

### Work Items

1. Create an appropriate repository on GitHub.

1. Socialize the existence of the repository.

1. Document process for proposing new policy documents.
